        First section - HTML: 
        We gonna learn about Elements and tags using h$*6, p, a, br, hr tags
        Here h$*6, p and a is paired tags and br and hr are self-closing tags
     -->
     
    <h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
    <hr>
    <p>This a para</p>
    <br>
    <a href="#">This is ancor tag</a>

    <!-- 
        Did you find something different in these elements:
        Some of them have openning as well as closing tag while other don't.

        *Elements that have openning and closing tags are called paired element.*
        E.g.: h$*6, p and a elements
         
        *Elements that don't have closing tag are self-closing or empty elements.*
        E.g.: br, hr elements

        I use two words there TAGS and ELEMENTS

        Tags are individual components, openning and closing tag.
        E.g.: <p> is *para openning tag* and </p> is *para closing tag*. 
        To create a closing tag, you simply add a '/' after '<' in the opening tag.

        And the combination of openning and closing tag are known as Elements.
        E.g.: <p>...</p> is a *paragraph element*

        Point to keep in mind: browser elemenate the extra whitespaces.

        Within the <a> tag, we use an *attribute* called 'href'. 
            **Attributes provide additional information to tags and are included in the opening tag.

        Lets move to our next section - CSS:
        We can add Css in 3 ways:
        Inline, Internal, External CSS.
        -> Starts with External CSS:To link an external CSS file with a .css extension, we use the <link> tag inside the <head> element.
        e.g.:  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
            /create a style.css file and start work in it./
            selector{
                property: value;
            }

             The <link> tag is used to connect external files to the HTML document.
            Here rel and href are the attributes of link tag.
            In this context, 
            **'rel' stands for 'relationship,' and it specifies that the relationship is a 'stylesheet,' which is used for presentation or formatting. 
            **'Href' stands for 'hyper reference' and points to the location of the external CSS file

        -> An alternative method for adding CSS is Internal CSS. This involves using a <style> element within the <head> section of the HTML document.
        e.g.:   <style>
                    selector{
                        property: value;
                    }
                </style>

        -> And Last method is to add style attribute to the element's openning tag.
        E.g.: <p style="property: value">....</p>
    -->

    <!-- 
        Let's move to very last section - JAVASCRIPT:
        We can add javascript in 2 ways: 
        Internal and external javascript.

        For adding internal javascript we simplly use script element before </body> tag and can work in it
        e.g.:   <script>
                    ....
                </script>

        For adding external javascript we need to use script tag along with src attribute having link of the file before </body> tag and can work in the .js extention file.
        e.g.: <script src="script.js"></script>
    -->

    <script></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
